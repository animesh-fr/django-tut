### How to make apps in Django

We make one project and then the rest of the time we design apps.
There are two major syntax in Jinja. We can also use | for piping.

-   {{first_name}}
-   {%csrf_token%}

To create a new app within django project

```js
python .\manage.py startapp myapp
```

After creating the app, the first step is to let the project know that there is a new app inside the project

```js
Go to settings.py file. Then find the array - INSTALLED_APPS
put the name of the app there.
```

Worked with jinja template and how to create master layout and programitically update the blocks, urls and other component of the view page.
